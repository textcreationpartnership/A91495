            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>The 24th Instant in the morning our Governour was from a Line of the Enemies unfortunately shot in the Body, as he was giving Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for breaking of Ground upon a little Eminence to the left of the Spur under <hi>Peter borough</hi> Tower, by which Work he designed to amose the Enemy: who thereupon taking encouragement from the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In this Action was killed and Wounded dight or ten Spaniards, and as many Morses, a Captain in the Scotch Regiment mortally Wounded, with seven or eight private Soldiers.</p>
            <p>The 25th, we perceived the Enemy had brought a Trench so very near our Stockade at <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151264:2"/> in order to a Mine, the Ground being very commodious for it, and had likewise brought their Cannon to our old Place of Arms, which is but a Pistol-shot from the Fort, which progress and bold Proceedings of theirs, put Colonel <hi>Sackville</hi> (who succeeded Sir <hi>Palmes Faireborne</hi> in his Command) upon calling a Council of War, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult what was fit to be done, for that it appeared without some extraordinary Action our new Work would be quickly in some distress; and in pursuance to the Resolutions that were then taken.</p>
            <p>On Wednesday the 27, by three of the Clock in the morning, the Garison was in Arms, and such care was taken, that as well taken in drawing together our Men, as in their march out of the Town, so great a silence was observed, that although the Enemy had had Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues on our very Walls, they cou'd not have take the least Alarm; our Foot was disposed into six Battalions, one of which was composed of Seamen, under the Command of Vice-Admiral <hi>Herbert,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded under him by Major <hi>Banlay,</hi> the other Battalions being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Major <hi>Hacket,</hi> Major <hi>Boynton,</hi> Captain <hi>Giles,</hi> Captain <hi>Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> and Captain <hi>Spot,</hi> the whole Party of Foot consisting of about 1500 Men; The Horse being seven Troops, amounting to 300, were commanded, the English by Captain <hi>Neatby,</hi> Captain <hi>Cay,</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Langston;</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> by <hi>Don Salvador de Montfarte Don Marique de Moronia</hi> (who commands two Troops) and <hi>Don Fernando Penatelo</hi> To amuse and divert the Enemy, the Horse belonging to the Mole, amounting to about 50 were ordered with Riders and a Trumpet at the head of them to March to the Spur at <hi>Peterborough-Tower,</hi> where we pitched several Colours, and had Drums appointed to beat a strong Alarm, Captain <hi>Makenny</hi> with the Town-Horse marching at the head of them. On the other side in the Bay where the Enemy had a Battery of 8 or 9 Guns, Admiral <hi>Herbert</hi> had appointed all the Boats of the Fleet with Waste-cloaths and Colours, to make shew as if they intended to attempt their Cannon; both which designs, especially the latter took very good effect, drawing a good number of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from their Trenches, which appeared by their pitching their Colours all a long the Coasts, and firing at the Boats. A particular Attack was likewise ordered to be made out of <hi>Pole-Fort</hi> by 150 Men under the command of Captain <hi>Lundy</hi> and Captain <hi>Hume,</hi> upon the

            <p>The Horse marched first out of <hi>Catherin Port,</hi> and drew up in the Stockade just before it, then the Foot, and drew up according to the direction of Colonel <hi>Sackville,</hi> which was performed with so great silence that the whole party was almost drawn up, before the Moors took the Alarm. The disposition of the several Divisions, Advanced-Parties, and Reserves both of Horse and Foot was ordered in the most proper and Soldier-like manner the ground would permit, and the Posts that were to be attacked required. When the Party was ready to advanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, Colonel <hi>Sackville</hi> gave the Signal to the Fort, from whence the Attack beforementioned upon the Enemies Gallery was to be first made; Major <hi>Beckman</hi> the Ingineer Marched out with them to give directions about demolishing the Enemies Worke, and stopping their Mine; The Attack proved a hot and very bloody piece of service, by reason of the Enemies having a greater Guard there than ordinary; the two Captains that commanded were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately carried off dangerously wounded, as were most of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers, among which was Lieutenant <hi>Robinson,</hi> and had not the Reserve come timely to their relief, that Party had run great hazard of being cut off. By this time the whole Body was engaged, the Enemy very stubbornly disputing every Line and Trench where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we attacked them, coming to Push of Pike, and handy-blows in several places; The particularities of every Action is hard to set down; but after we had beaten them from their new Trenches, we advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the old Line, where our Forts formerly stood, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with great loss on our side (there being not above 50 Men left in one of the Battalions of my Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi>'s Regiment) and at length by levelling the Trenches made a passage for the Horse, through which Captain <hi>Neatby</hi> with his Troop advanced upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151264:3"/> &amp; Foot, who made very great slaughter among them; Many of their Horse performed very daringly for the rescue of their Foot, among which several of their principa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

We took two pieces of Cannon, five Colours, several Prisoners, and had taken many more had they not refused quarter, and killed by computation about 500. After our Horse and Foot were retreated within our old Lines, which we pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed from <hi>James</hi> to <hi>Monmonth Fort,</hi> we fell to filling and level<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Palmes Fairborne</hi> our Governour, having first had the satisfaction to hear of our success, whose loss is very much lamented by the whole Garison.</p>
            <p>In the mean time such of the Enemies dead that remained unburied, being laid together near <hi>Catherine Port,</hi> Colonel <hi>Sackville</hi> our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Commander, writ to the <hi>Alcayde,</hi> offering him leave to bury them: He, or some body for him (for it is uncertain yet whether he be living or dead) returned a very civil Answer, and accordingly the Moors fetcht off the Bodies, (and brought three of ours that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Field) in a very melanchol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
